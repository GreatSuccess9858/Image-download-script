The Amphe-PD‰ã¢ connector series is ideally suited for the datacom industry, as well as many other applications. The Amphe-PD‰ã¢ connector generates more processing power with less heat than a similar-sized connector. The series produces greater amperage without wasting valuable space, offering a compact solution for datacom applications, which require small, yet powerful connectors.

The Amphe-PD‰ã¢ connector series is ideally suited for the datacom industry, as well as many other applications. The Amphe-PD‰ã¢ connector generates more processing power with less heat than a similar-sized connector. The series produces greater amperage without wasting valuable space, offering a compact solution for datacom applications, which require small, yet powerful connectors. The Amphe-PD‰ã¢ features a single position RADSOK¨ with moulded socket shell or a dual-position TUV touch-proof with a V0 rating. In addition, the RADSOK¨ in the Amphe-PD‰ã¢ supports a 50 to 70A continuous duty rating.

It offers a wide selection of blindmateable drawer connectors to suit modular equipment designs. The term drawer connector was created to describe a cabinet drawer where the connector is installed at the back of the drawer and is mated by closing the drawer. Since the drawer is often times made with a somewhat loose fit - to enable easy opening and closing, the drawer connector must provide sufficient self-alignment and ideally a floating connection to the cabinet or drawer to keep the connection from binding. Some of the benefits of the power drawer connector from Tyco Electronics are the robustness of the housing designs and the durability of the contacts.
